This script is a Bash script designed to automate the process of updating Kubernetes manifest files in a Git repository hosted on Azure DevOps. It pulls the repository, makes changes, commits, and pushes the updates back to the repository.

Let's break down each step in detail:

1. Shebang Line
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
This specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell. It's a standard line for Bash scripts.

2. Enable Debugging Mode
bash
Copy code
set -x
set -x is used to enable a debugging mode where each command is printed to the terminal before it is executed. This helps in tracking the script's flow and is useful for debugging.

3. Set the Repository URL
bash
Copy code
REPO_URL="https://<ACCESS-TOKEN>@dev.azure.com/<AZURE-DEVOPS-ORG-NAME>/voting-app/_git/voting-app"
This line defines a variable, REPO_URL, that stores the Git repository URL.
The URL includes an <ACCESS-TOKEN>, which is a placeholder for your Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT). This token allows the script to authenticate and access the repository securely.
<AZURE-DEVOPS-ORG-NAME> should be replaced with your Azure DevOps organization name.
The repository being cloned is called voting-app.

4. Clone the Git Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone "$REPO_URL" /tmp/temp_repo
This command clones the Git repository from the specified REPO_URL into a temporary directory located at /tmp/temp_repo.
/tmp is often used for temporary files, and the directory temp_repo is created to hold the cloned repository.

5. Navigate into the Cloned Repository
bash
Copy code
cd /tmp/temp_repo
The cd command changes the working directory to /tmp/temp_repo, where the repository has been cloned.
This is necessary to run subsequent Git and file manipulation commands within the context of the repository.

6. Modify the Kubernetes Manifest
bash
Copy code
sed -i "s|image:.*|image: <ACR-REGISTRY-NAME>/$2:$3|g" k8s-specifications/$1-deployment.yaml
This line uses the sed command (stream editor) to modify a Kubernetes manifest file, specifically a YAML file that defines a Kubernetes deployment.
The expression s|image:.*|image: <ACR-REGISTRY-NAME>/$2:$3|g is a substitution pattern that does the following:
image:.* matches any line that starts with image:, followed by any characters (.*).
The matched part is replaced with image: <ACR-REGISTRY-NAME>/$2:$3.
<ACR-REGISTRY-NAME> is a placeholder for your Azure Container Registry (ACR) name.
$2 and $3 are positional parameters passed to the script, representing the image name (or microservice) and the version tag, respectively.
k8s-specifications/$1-deployment.yaml refers to the deployment YAML file where $1 is another positional parameter that should contain the service or deployment name.

7. Add the Modified Files to the Git Index
bash
Copy code
git add .
This command stages all modified files in the repository for commit. The dot (.) means that all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories will be staged.

8. Commit the Changes
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Update Kubernetes manifest"
This creates a Git commit with a message "Update Kubernetes manifest". This step records the changes in the local Git repository.

9. Push the Changes to the Remote Repository
bash
Copy code
git push
This pushes the committed changes from the local repository back to the remote repository (Azure DevOps in this case).

10. Cleanup the Temporary Directory
bash
Copy code
rm -rf /tmp/temp_repo
The rm -rf command deletes the /tmp/temp_repo directory and all of its contents.
The -r flag stands for recursive, meaning it will delete all files and subdirectories, and the -f flag forces the deletion without prompting for confirmation.
This step ensures that the temporary cloned repository is removed after the script finishes.
Positional Parameters
$1: Represents the name of the service or deployment, used to identify which deployment YAML file to modify.
$2: Represents the image name or microservice name in the Azure Container Registry (ACR).
$3: Represents the version tag of the container image, which will be inserted into the Kubernetes manifest.

Summary
This script automates the process of updating Kubernetes deployment manifests, including:

Cloning a repository from Azure DevOps.
Modifying the image field in a deployment manifest to update the container image and version.
Committing and pushing the changes back to the repository.
Cleaning up the temporary cloned repository.
